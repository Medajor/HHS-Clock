# HHS-Clock
A clock for the IB program at Hillsborough High School.

This program is displayed in all the rooms at this HS to indicate the current time at the school, and to act as a secondary bell system.
As this school has two programs, one on a block schedule and one on a regular schedule, this bell will "ring" at a certain time to tell the students in the block schedule when to transition.

AutoDay will automatically determine if it is Monday and then show the early release schedule.
AutoDayNewspaper will do the same, but will also display a message encouraging students to read the newspaper

The rest lack this feature and simply show the schedule indicated by their name. They are meant for non-regular days.

To change the schedule, just change the array at the beginning of file to your schedule. The comments in-code should guide you. 

If there are any questions, feel free to contact me.
